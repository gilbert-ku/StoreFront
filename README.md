## üèó Challenge Overview  

Your task is to build a **basic storefront** using the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The project should include the following:

You can stick to the basics or take it further by adding optional enhancements to demonstrate your skill level. Some examples include:

- Implementing **multiple routes** for navigation (e.g., separate pages for Product Details, Cart, etc.).  
- A polished UI with **thoughtful visuals** and **user interactions** (e.g., hover effects, animations).  
- Error handling for network requests (e.g., loading spinners, error messages).  
- Unit or integration tests to validate critical functionality.  

Feel free to take an approach that matches your expertise and comfort level.
